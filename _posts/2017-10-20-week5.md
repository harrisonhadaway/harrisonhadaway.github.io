# Week 5 = Humbling Experience

### The reality of learning new things.

Besides being taught and exposed to many wonderful technologies in the past 5 weeks I would have to say that I have actually started to learn more about myself than anything else. Previously to bootcamp, I have always loved challenging technologies typically learning anything before bootcamp on my own. Also previously to bootcamp, I absolutely despised high school and college classes. I knew walking into this bootcamp I would struggle at some point. 

### Overcoming struggles.

Part of my troubles previously with classes were me being able to keep my focus. The first two weeks of bootcamp I had a pretty sharp focus. My mind seems to be able to focus on anything brand new for a while then once the new is worn off my mind seems to get bored.
