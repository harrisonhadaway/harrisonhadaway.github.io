# Equipment Tracker

### The need for this project
My former employer owned many pieces of farm equipment and had a collection of other various vehicles. We never could perfect a system for keeping up with all of the equipment and records. Equipment Tracker is the solution for my former employer.

### User Stories
1. As an equipment owner, I want to store general information on my equipment in a central database, where I can access necessary information without having to continually get it off of the machine.
2. As the equipment owner, I want to be able to add maintenance records to the equipment in my database so that I can assure that my equipment is getting proper care. 
3. As the equipment owner, I would like to be able to store all digital manuals that relate to a specific piece of equipment with the equipment on my database.

### Logged in users can:
1. Register new equipment
2. Add maintenance records
3. Store user and maintenance manuals
4. Update all fields of the equipment profile, and individual maintenance records

### Live Demo 
You are welcome to do a live demo of this project. Authentication is required, but for demo purposes I will provide link, username, and password below.
