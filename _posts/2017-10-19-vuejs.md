# Vue.js
## A progressive framework

Vue.js is a very young progressive javascript framework. It's initial realease was in February of 2014 and it is steadily growing in popularity. 

This is the first javascript framework I have used, and I really like it. Being at the beginning of a new career in Web Development, I feel like I will see Vue.js throughout my future career. 

Vue offers a component system that is my favorite feauture about Vue. Being able to split multiple components into their on seperate files then the ablility to reference back to those already built components on any part of the application makes like much easier.
