# Some people ask why? 

In the past few years, I have been able to live a life of getting to experience many different possible career paths. The life lessons I have learned in that process are worth more than any university class. In the past year, I have worked mostly doing farm/ property management all while waiting for my chance at getting back into a career path to work in information technology.  As my search for the perfect IT job continued I kept coming across these web developer bootcamps online. I started to slowly start looking into bootcamps across the United States, but I was so intimidated to even apply for these crazy intensive and expensive bootcamps. 

### Why Awesome Inc U? 

Truthfully, I stumbled upon Awesome Inc U online. Immediately, I realized that Awesome Inc was different compared to a lot of other bootcamps. Awesome Inc was not one of the “pop-up overnight bootcamps” that everyone online was warning people about. Awesome Inc has a very diverse portfolio from doing coding classes for the youth in Lexington year round, the bootcamp, being an entrepreneur incubator, co-sharing office space, and very close ties with an actual software company, APAX Software. While I understand bootcamp’s are a money making business in themselves I was drawn to Awesome Inc for the fact that their bootcamp was not their first and only rodeo when it came to teaching individuals to become developers. 

### Why become a web developer?

Since I was a child, I have always had to know how and why anything tangible worked. There is not a better feeling in the world than figuring out how to build to build something, building that something, and being able to step back to see the final something. It took me time to really wrap my mind around that being a developer is not much different than any other technical skill job. Not quite as rigorous on the body, but after my first week of bootcamp it might be just as rigorous on my brain through this bootcamp.

I want to be a web developer to have a life of building tangible things for businesses and people. I am looking forward to being able to help businesses and people by building the tools they need to be successful.
